We will be working hard to expand our plans and develop our own NFT Marketplace and DEX. One of the main priorities, however, is to develop a rug pull protection insurance protocol for all of the tokens and NFT holders. One big goal is to go multi-chain as well and discover the options of having our own Avalanche Subnet.",
